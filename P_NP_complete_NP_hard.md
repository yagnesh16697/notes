## P, NP-complete, and NP-hard

- P, NP-complete, and NP-hard are concepts in computational complexity theory, which is concerned with the difficulty of solving computational problems.

- P problems are decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time, meaning that the time it takes to solve the problem is proportional to a polynomial function of the size of the input. Examples of P problems include sorting a list of numbers or finding the shortest path between two points in a graph.

- NP problems, on the other hand, are decision problems for which a solution can be verified in polynomial time. In other words, if you are given a possible solution, you can check that it is correct in polynomial time. Examples of NP problems include the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem.

- NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP, in the sense that any problem in NP can be reduced to an NP-complete problem in polynomial time. This means that if you can solve an NP-complete problem in polynomial time, you can solve any NP problem in polynomial time. The most famous NP-complete problem is the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), which asks whether there is an assignment of truth values to boolean variables that makes a given boolean formula true.

- NP-hard problems are at least as hard as NP-complete problems, but they may not be in NP themselves. This means that they may not have a verifiable solution in polynomial time, but they are still considered to be computationally very difficult. Examples of NP-hard problems include the graph coloring problem and the traveling salesman problem.
